      "One of the most overlooked skills in trading isn't which indicator to use or which pair to trade—it's how much to risk per trade. Blow up your size once and you'll understand why. The goal of position sizing is simple: keep drawdowns within a range you can tolerate emotionally and financially, so you stay in the game long enough for your edge to play out.",
      "Two common approaches are fixed fractional (risk a set percentage of your account per trade, e.g. 1%) and percentage-of-equity (adjust that percentage as your account grows or shrinks). Neither is magic, but both force you to define risk before you enter and to scale position size to your stop distance. If your stop is 50 pips, your risk per pip should be sized so that 50 pips equals your chosen risk amount.",
      "Fixed fractional sizing means every trade risks the same percentage of your current equity. A $10,000 account risking 1% risks $100 per trade. After a loss, the next trade still risks 1% of the new balance—so you automatically reduce size when you're down and increase when you're up. That built-in discipline helps prevent runaway drawdowns.",
      "Percentage-of-equity takes that idea further by sometimes adjusting the percentage based on recent performance or volatility. The core principle is the same: define risk as a fraction of capital and size each position so that your stop distance equals that risk. The math is straightforward once you know your stop in pips or points and your risk per trade in dollars.",
      "Start conservative. Many traders begin with 0.5% or 1% per trade and only consider increasing once they've seen a long run of consistent execution and results. There's no prize for risking more—only for surviving and compounding over time.",
      "The best position size is the one that lets you sleep at night and come back the next day. If you're constantly worried about a single trade, you're too big. Scale down until your emotions stay in check, then focus on execution and edge. Position sizing isn't sexy, but it's the foundation everything else sits on.",

      "Higher highs and higher lows define an uptrend; lower highs and lower lows define a downtrend. When price breaks that pattern—for example, making a lower low in an uptrend—you get a break of structure (BOS). That doesn't always mean the trend is over, but it does mean the structure has changed and you should pay attention.",
      "Structure tells you where price has been and often where it might go next. Swing highs and swing lows act as magnets: pullbacks to structure in a trend often offer entries, and breaks of key structure can signal continuation or reversal. The key is to mark structure clearly, avoid drawing every tiny wiggle, and use it to define your bias and your invalidation.",
      "Not every high and low is a swing point. Focus on the clearest pivots—places where price clearly reversed and left a visible level. On higher timeframes, fewer swing points matter; on lower timeframes, you'll see more. Match the structure you draw to the timeframe you trade.",
      "Break of structure can mean continuation or reversal. In an uptrend, a break below a recent swing low might signal a deeper pullback or a trend change. Context matters: where did the break happen relative to key levels? Did volume or momentum confirm? Don't assume every BOS is a reversal; sometimes it's just a shakeout before the trend resumes.",
      "Use structure to define your invalidation. If you're long on a pullback to a swing low, your stop typically belongs below that low. If price takes out that level, the structure that supported your idea is broken. Let the market tell you when you're wrong instead of hoping.",
      "Don't fight the structure. If the chart is making higher highs and higher lows, look for longs on pullbacks, not shorts at the top. Reading structure isn't about predicting the future—it's about aligning your trades with the path price has already shown you.",

Why did you take it? Did you move your stop or exit early? A sentence or two on mood and context pays off when you look back.",

      "Use the journal to audit your plan. If you're consistently taking trades that aren't in your plan, either your plan is wrong or your discipline is. If you're following the plan and still losing, the plan may need adjustment. The journal is the evidence; don't rely on memory.",

      "The ECC11 approach ties market structure and timing together. Structure tells you where price has been and where it might go; timing helps you decide when to enter rather than chasing or entering too early. Used together, they give you a framework for reading the chart and planning trades.",
      "Structure in this context means swing highs and lows, breaks of structure, and key levels. Timing means waiting for price to show you something—a pullback, a hold of a level, or a clear signal—before you commit. The idea is to align with the trend or the shift in structure, then enter when the moment is right, not when you're impatient.",
      "Structure answers \"what is the market doing?\" Timing answers \"when do I get in?\" Without structure, you're guessing direction. Without timing, you're chasing or entering too early. Both matter.",
      "The framework emphasizes clarity: clean levels, clear invalidation, and a defined entry trigger. That reduces discretionary guesswork and makes it easier to review and improve over time.",
      "This is an introduction; the full framework is taught in depth through Dr. Kathy Kirkland's mentorship and related programs. If you're interested in going deeper, look for structured education that includes live application and feedback, not just theory.",

      "Liquidity in the market isn't evenly distributed. Orders cluster around certain price levels: obvious highs and lows, round numbers, and areas where many traders place stops. Institutions and larger players often use that information—sweeping stops to trigger orders before moving price in the other direction.",
      "You don't need to become an order-flow expert to use the idea. If you notice that price often dips below a clear low (taking out stops) and then reverses, you're seeing a form of liquidity grab. That doesn't mean every such move is tradeable, but it can help you avoid selling the exact low or buying the exact high when you're looking for reversals or continuation.",
      "Equal highs and equal lows—\"liquidity pools\" where stops cluster—often get swept before price reverses. That doesn't mean you should always fade the sweep; sometimes it's the start of a bigger move. Use liquidity as context, not as the only reason to enter.",
      "Keep it simple. Mark key highs and lows and watch how price behaves around them. Don't overload your chart with liquidity zones and order blocks unless you're willing to backtest and refine.",
      "One or two clear levels often matter more than a busy map. The goal is to improve your entries and avoid obvious traps, not to build a complex order-flow model. Start with structure; add liquidity context when it helps.",

      "Set alerts for the setups you care about: key support or resistance, a moving average touch, or a break of structure. When the alert fires, open the chart and decide with a clear head—don't feel obligated to trade just because price arrived. Alerts are there to bring opportunity to you, not to force your hand.",
      "Use price alerts for key levels: \"Notify me when EUR/USD hits 1.0850.\" Use indicator alerts sparingly—e.g. when a moving average cross happens on your timeframe. Too many alerts become noise; a few well-chosen ones keep you informed without overwhelming you.",

A mentor who has a track record of teaching (not just trading) and who emphasizes risk and psychology is worth more than a guru who only shows wins.
